## Vision
This project can help teach our potential audience valuable lessons about dementia, through the use of empathy. The vision of the project is to demonstrate that simple tasks, such as finding one's toothbrush, can be almost insurmountable when one has dementia. 
The user is situated in a house with a caretaker to assist them. The goal of this experience is to generate awareness and empathy for those with dementia by focusing on the visual impairments associated with this disorder.

## Narrative
In a team of four people, we were assigned with the task to ideate and develop "A VR experience that puts dementia care workers in the shoes of someone who has dementia would go a long way toward understanding the people theyâ€™re taking care of."

The team decided to go for a story based experience, where they are take the place of a person with dementia and have a someone helping them regularly with daily tasks. The user does not have many interactions other than asking for help, and experience first hand visual impairments that try to annoy when triggered, this, with the intent of being frustrating to try to generate empathy.
